## 18. MagicNumber

Goal for this exercise is:

- Write contract to solver address that responds to "whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()"


<br/>

Here is the contract code:
~~~
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract MagicNum {

  address public solver;

  constructor() public {}

  function setSolver(address _solver) public {
    solver = _solver;
  }

  /*
    ____________/\\\_______/\\\\\\\\\_____
     __________/\\\\\_____/\\\///////\\\___
      ________/\\\/\\\____\///______\//\\\__
       ______/\\\/\/\\\______________/\\\/___
        ____/\\\/__\/\\\___________/\\\//_____    
         __/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_____/\\\//________   
          _\///////////\\\//____/\\\/___________  
           ___________\/\\\_____/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_ 
            ___________\///_____\///////////////__
  */
}

Hint here was to use only opcodes..
